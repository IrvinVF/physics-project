For my class, I had to read how much sunlight there was during a 24-hour lapse. I could do it with an LDR via arduino. Fall 2020 &lt;3

# How does it work?
In order to read every value of sunlight, the arduino was connected every hour. The original idea was to make this step automatized, keeping Arduino plugged in 24/7.
